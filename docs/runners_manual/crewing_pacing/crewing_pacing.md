## Crewing and Pacing

1. Respect the land and other users you encounter, especially those who may not be affiliated with or aware of the run.
2. The Aid Station Captain is in charge of the aid station, including where & when crews will be allowed.
3. Supplies and facilities are limited.  Plan to be self-sufficient, and leave the water, food and facilities for the runners, pacers and run staff.
4. Respect the environment.  Park where directed, pack out all trash, and use only appropriate bathroom practices/facilities.
5. Pets are not allowed in aid stations.
6. Children are allowed in aid stations only under adult supervision.
7. Pacers may meet their runner at Crew Access Aid Stations only.
8. Crews may not intentionally meet their runners outside of crew aid stations.  
9. Crewing is generally limited to a 400-yard radius of the aid station.  Aid Station Captains may extend or limit this as the site requires.
10. No drones will be permitted unless a permit has been secured through the Bureau of Land Management AND HardrockHundred Endurance Run.
11. Runners will be issued a single crew pass, allowing one crew vehicle to park in designated areas for the Cunningham, Animas Forks and Chapman Gulch aid stations. While through traffic will be allowed in those areas, only vehicles with a pass will be allowed to stop or park.  Vehicles looking to park without a crew pass may be directed multiple miles away from the aid station.
12. All pacers must check-in with aid station personnel and sign a waiver at the respective aid station where they intend to join their runner. This can also be done pre-run at runner check-in. Upon signing the waiver, pacers will receive a wristband. This wristband must be worn while on course with their runner.
13. Pacers are not allowed to leave vehicles at Animas Forks, Sherman or Cunningham Gulch Aid Stations to be picked up after the run.
14. Pacers must run at least the whole leg to the next crew access or specifically allowed aid station, as there is generally no access for them in between. 
15. Runners are limited to a single pacer at a time. Pacers may not continue unless accompanying their runner.
 
Pacers are allowed from Ouray (Mile 43.9) to the finish. Pacers may also start or stop at crew access aid stations (Animas Forks, Sherman, Cunningham).  Pacers may hike in to the Maggie Aid Station from the base of CR2 (a 3.25mi hike) to join their runner.  NO CREWING at Maggie - the only ones hiking up should be joining their runner on course out of the aid station.
 
Runners over 60 years old may have pacers for the entire run.

*Runners are responsible and accountable for the actions of their crews/pacers before, during and after the run. Notable rule violations will be taken up by the Run Director and a tribunal of run staff. Penalties may include time penalties, disqualification and/or banning from future Hardrocks. The Run Director has final discretion on all penalties and questions that arise.*
