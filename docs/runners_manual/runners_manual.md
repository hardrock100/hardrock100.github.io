## Welcome

Weâ€™re excited to have you join us at the Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run!
 
Hardrock is an ultramarathon of approximately 102.5 miles in length, plus roughly 33,197 feet of climb and 33,197 feet of descent, at an average elevation of over 11,000 feet. The run is held on a loop course on 4WD roads, dirt trails, and cross country in southwest Colorado's San Juan Range, USA.
 
The run starts and ends in Silverton, Colorado and connects the mountain towns of Ophir, Telluride, Ouray, and Sherman (Lake City), crossing thirteen major passes over 12,000 feet, with the highest point on the course being the 14,048 foot Handies Peak summit. The run is annually held in mid-July, and reverses direction each year. At the finish, runners kiss the iconic Hardrock (a picture of a ram's head painted on a large block of stone mining debris).
 
**In 2022, the run will be held in a clockwise direction.**
 
Our course offers a graduate-level challenge for endurance runs. The course is designed to provide extreme challenges in altitude, steepness, and remoteness. 
 
The cut-off time for finishing the run is 48 hours. Current fastest performances are held by Francois D'Haene (21:45), set in 2021 and Diana Finkel (27:18), set in 2009. The average time required to finish this run clockwise is 39:52:17. The course covers extremely rugged terrain including steep scree climbs and descents, snow packs, river crossings, and boulder fields. Runners who finish in over 40 hours will experience two sunsets.
 
The run was founded in 1992 by Gordon Hardman, John Cappis, Charlie Thorn and Rick Trujillo as a tribute to the old time miners who followed their mules and instincts, prospecting the San Juans for gold, silver, and other metals. These miners endured cold, snow and avalanches, hunger, mining accidents, and a host of other hazards that we have difficulty imagining today. The miners enjoyed the immense beauty of the San Juans regardless of the risks, and we hope you find the same on your wild and tough adventure.
