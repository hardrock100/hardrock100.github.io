## Joel Zucker Memorial Scholarship

The Joel Zucker Memorial ScholarshipAA was created in memory of Joel Zucker who died at the age of 44, two days after completing his third Hardrock Hundred run in July 1998. Joel loved Silverton and running in the mountains and was loved by all who knew him. He was an inspiration to many people who thought they could never run a hundred miles. Joel always managed to finish the run within the last 10 minutes of the 48-hour deadline.
 
The scholarship is awarded to High School seniors from the San Juan Mountains region. Additional scholarships are given to former recipients to continue their undergraduate education. Students must apply in writing and be interviewed to qualify.
 
Money for this scholarship is raised entirely by donations received from Hardrock Hundred runners, volunteers, and partners, as well as friends and family of Joel.
