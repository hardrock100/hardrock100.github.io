## Aid Stations

Hardrock annually has 14 or 15 aid stations, depending on the direction of the run, and these together comprise the largest group of volunteers. Each aid station will have an Aid Station Captain and crew of 6-30 volunteers.

While all Hardrock Aid Stations strive to maintain a high level of care for the runners, logistics such as space, access and location necessarily cause some differences in what is available. Each aid station, regardless of location, typically goes above & beyond with a specialty "off-menu" dish for runners.

**Hike-In (Kroger's Canteen, Engineer, Pole Creek):**
The intrepid volunteers who staff these aid stations carry in all supplies using their own strong backs (and pack animals, if available), sometimes making multiple trips. Tasks include on-site filtering of gallons of water, digging a latrine, and collecting & chopping firewood. Food variety and quantity is limited, but the essentials are available of typical aid station food groups. Their backcountry location makes it important to abide by Leave No Trace principles and keep staffing numbers smaller. No Crew Access.

**Road-Side (KT, Chapman, Governors, Burrows, Maggie, Cunningham):**
These stations typically have a bit food variety with multiple hot options, but are still limited by space.  A few are allowed crew access (typically with some restrictions) or drop bags.  Often residing in obscure pull-outs on key road crossings along the route, they provide a brief respite to refuel and warm up between long hours and arduous climbs/descents.

**"The Big 4" (Telluride, Ouray, Grouse, Sherman):**
With the widest variety of available amenities, the "Big 4" aid stations can be depended on to have copious options for hot food & beverages, drop bags & other services. Runners often spend their longest breaks here, resetting their gear and stomachs for the miles ahead. Lights, port-a-potties/bathrooms, crew access and drop bags are standard. They have lots of action, lots of people, and generally the biggest volunteer staffs.

A typical aid station menu contains:

| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Coffee/Tea/Cocoa | Pretzels               |

| Cookies          | Fig Bars               |
| Chips            | Bananas/Oranges/Melons |
 
Stations with vehicle access will also likely have:

|                 |                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Boiled Potatoes   | Boiled Sweet Potatoes      |
| Turkey Sandwiches | Wraps/Quesadillas/Burritos |
| Avocadoes         | Bacon & Eggs               |
| Pumpkin Pie       | Black Beans & Rice         |
| Brisket           |                            |
 
Hardrock will strive to have options for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free runners. However, the accessibility of some aid stations may limit selection. 
 
Runners with strict food restrictions should be prepared with their own food, as cross-contamination is hard to prevent in the backcountry.
