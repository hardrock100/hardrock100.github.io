## Safety

This is a dangerous course! In addition to trail running, you will likely:
<div class="printme"></div>
* Wade knee-deep, ice-cold streams
* Cross snow fields in both slick and post-holing conditions
* Traverse trails with 300’+ cliffs immediately to one side
* Rock climb (mild, but hands required)
* Be caught above treeline in extreme thunderstorms
 
It is recommended to always carry at least one *more* warm item than you think you will need.  Every year, runners get stuck unexpectedly due to injury or weather.  Hypothermia can be a killer, especially on tired bodies with no reserves left for generating heat.
 
The run start and some of the aid stations are at a relatively low elevation (7,700-9,000 feet) and in sheltered valleys, while most of the run takes place above 11,000 feet in exposed areas above timberline. Temperatures and wind conditions can be markedly different up high and the temperature can suddenly and dramatically drop. 
 
In a typical year, you will have wet feet 90% or more of your run.

**Weather**
 
Weather is a critical factor in Hardrock and can be at least as formidable as the terrain, remoteness, or high elevation.  Every runner should carry gear appropriate for drenching rain, high winds, and near-freezing temperatures - possibly all at the same time.
 
Typically there is a brief period each year when the snow is generally gone, but the summer "monsoon" has not yet gotten into full swing – we attempt to hit this window.
 
The "monsoon" is a daily weather cycle. Calm mornings, but as the day warms up, thunderheads build up and intense thunderstorms may occur each afternoon, abating in the evening and through the night.
 
The 48hr Cut-Off is not only in recognition of the difficult terrain, but also allows runners to wait out thunderstorms or other life-threatening weather. You can hunker down in a valley for 2-4 hours and still finish. However, if you get fried by lightning, your running career may end on the spot. Discretion is the better part of valor.
 
The Run Director may authorize Aid Captains to hold runners if weather conditions are considered too dangerous and prevent runners from continuing if not carrying gear appropriate for conditions.
 
**Lightning**
 
Several runners in past years have had direct contact with lightning and there have been several more near misses. If caught in lightning, head to lower terrain as fast as you can.  If you cannot, find a low point or shelter away from conductors (poles, trees).  
 
If your hair begins to stand on end and/or your skin starts to tingle, a lightning strike is imminent.  Assume the lightning position to wait out the storm:
1. If you are with a group of runners, spread out by at least 50' **Very important**
2. Put your feet together
3. Crouch slightly
4. Minimize contact with the ground and other conductors (stay on the balls of your feet)
5. Cover your ears
6. Touch your elbows to your knees to give current a path to flow other than through your torso
 
**Snow**
 
The course passes by several snow features whose danger varies year-to-year.  Large snow fields may be sloped and extremely slick at night, while present post-holing above fields of sharp scree during the day.  Use caution when approaching the edges of snowfields from above or below, as cornices (layers of snow overhanging open space) may fall from above or collapse beneath your feet.
 
**First Aid**
 
If you encounter a person who is injured, first GET HELP through official run channels, then keep the victim warm.  All aid stations are staffed by at least an EMT, have a first aid kit, and have radio communication.  
 
Additionally, each runner carries a SPOT tracker which is used to pinpoint their location at all times.
 
Most medical problems will be relatively minor: sunburn, blisters, sprains, abrasions, and fatigue. In the later stages of the run, runners may also be dehydrated, fatigued, nauseated and/or hallucinating.  Stretches between aid stations can last 6 hours or more.  Be aware of these factors as you plan for your run.
 
**Search and Rescue**
 
All Search and Rescue missions are initiated by the Run Director.
 
Hardrock purchases a CORSAR Card (Colorado Search and Rescue) for every runner. These will be available at Runner Check-In. It is highly recommended that crews and pacers also purchase a CORSAR Card.
 
All runners are required to carry a run-provided GPS Tracking device from [MAProgress](http://maprogress.com/). This will facilitate our efforts to locate and access you more efficiently in a Search and Rescue operation. Training on the operations of this device will be provided prior to the run as part of packet pickup.
 
**Dropping Out**
 
While no one likes to contemplate it, there may come a time when it is smarter for you to drop out than to continue. Also, you may miss the cutoff times or be pulled for a medical reason. However the decision is made, you must ensure the nearest Aid Station Captain is informed and have them cut off your ID bracelet.
 
Depending on your location, it may be very hard for us to arrange transportation from your dropout point to the finish. You may have to wait many hours for this, as we may have to coordinate a vehicle via radio. All we can promise is a best try effort.
