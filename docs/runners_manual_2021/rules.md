## Rules

1. No Muling.
2. You must leave each aid station by the [posted Cut-Off time](/docs/runners_manual_2021/course/aid_station_table/). If you return, it will be assumed you have abandoned your run attempt.
3. No stashing of supplies along the course and no accepting aid except within 400 yards of a designated aid station.
4. You have agreed to be pulled for medical and safety reasons if it is determined that such action is in your best interest.
5. Aid Station Captains have the authority to act on behalf of the Hardrock run management.
6. Pacers may meet their runners at [crew access aid stations](/docs/runners_manual_2021/course/aid_station_table/) only.
7. The course is closed - runners are required to follow the specified route.  If you deviate from the route, you must backtrack to the point at which you departed before continuing.
8. All runners must complete a [Service Requirement](https://www.hardrock100.com/files/trailwork/HR100-2021-Service-Form.pdf).
9. All runners are required to carry a run-provided [GPS Tracking](https://www.hardrock100.com/hardrock-runner-tracking.php) device.
10. Runners are responsible and accountable for the actions of their crews/pacers before, during and after the run.
11. Runners are not allowed to take a ride in a vehicle where it advances their progress or compensates for runner error. Runners may, after checking into an aid station, rest and get warm in a stationary vehicle.
 
Notable rule violations will be taken up by the [Run Director](mailto:dale@hardrock100.com) and a tribunal of run staff.  Penalties may include disqualification and/or banning from future Hardrocks.  The Run Director has final discretion on all penalties and questions that arise.
