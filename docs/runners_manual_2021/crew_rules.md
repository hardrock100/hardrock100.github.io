## Crewing and Pacing

1. The Aid Station Captain is in charge of the aid station, including where & when crews will be allowed.
2. Supplies and facilities are limited.  Plan to be self-sufficient, and leave the water, food and facilities for the runners, pacers and race staff.
3. Respect the environment.  Park where directed, pack out all trash, and use only appropriate bathroom practices/facilities.
4. Pets are not allowed in aid stations.
5. Children are allowed in aid stations only under adult supervision.
6. Pacers may meet their runner at Crew Access Aid Stations only.
8. Crews may not meet their runners outside of crew aid stations.  
9. Crewing is generally limited to a 400 yard radius of the aid station.  Aid Station Captains may extend or limit this as the site requires.
10. All pacers must check-in with aid station personnel and sign a waiver at the respective aid station where they intend to join their runner. This can also be done pre-race at runner check-in. Upon signing the waiver, pacers will receive a wristband. This wristband must be worn while on course with their runner.
11. No drones will be permitted unless a permit has been secured through the Bureau of Land Management AND HardrockHundred Endurance Run.
12. Respect the land and other users you encounter, especially those who may not be affiliated with or aware of the run.
14. Pacers must run at least the whole leg to the next crew access or specifically allowed aid station, as there is generally no access for them in between. 
15. Pacers may not continue unless accompanying their runner.
 
Pacers are allowed from Grouse (Mile 42.2) to the finish. Pacers may also start or stop at crew access aid stations (Ouray, Telluride, Chapman), as well as the KT Aid Station provided they park at the South Mineral Campground and hike the two miles into the aid station. 
 
Runners over 60 years old may have pacers for the entire run.
