## Joel Zucker Memorial Scholarship

The Joel Zucker Memorial Scholarship was created in memory of Joel Zucker who died at the age of 44, two days after completing his third Hardrock Hundred run in July 1998. Joel loved Silverton and running in the mountains and was loved by all who knew him. He was an inspiration to many people who thought they could never run a hundred miles. Joel always managed to finish the run within the last 10 minutes of the 48-hour deadline.
 
The scholarship is awarded by the Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run to San Juan Mountain High School seniors or to seniors from the region with a connection to the run. Additional scholarships are given to former recipients to continue their undergraduate education. Students must apply in writing and be interviewed to qualify.
 
Money for this scholarship is raised entirely by donations received from Hardrock Hundred runners, volunteers, and partners, as well as friends and family of Joel. 
 
Donations can be sent payable to “Community Foundation Serving Southwest Colorado”, PO Box 1673, Durango, CO 81302. Include the words, "Joel Zucker Scholarship" on the memo line.
