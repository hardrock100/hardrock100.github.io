## Drop Bags

Runners are allowed to provide drop bags for transport to [designated aid stations](https://hardrock100.github.io/docs/runners_manual_2021/course/aid_station_table/):
Chapman Gulch (Mile 18.1)
Telluride (Mile 27.8)
Ouray (Mile 43.9)
Grouse (Mile 58.4)
Sherman (Mile 71.9)
Cunningham (Mile 91.2)
Finish (Mile 100.5)

Drop bags may be dropped off at the American Legion building (11th and Greene) between 0800-1500 Monday-Thursday of run week, with a final deadline of 1500 on Thursday.
 
Please weatherproof your bags as much as is reasonable. We cannot guarantee full weather protection for every bag. That can be as simple as putting your clothing in a Ziplock bag inside the main bag.
 
Drop bags will be returned to the Legion by the end of the Awards Breakfast on Sunday.
