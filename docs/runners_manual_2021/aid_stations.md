## Aid Stations

Hardrock annually has 14 or 15 aid stations, depending on the direction of the run, and these together comprise the largest group of volunteers. Each aid station will have an Aid Station Captain and crew of 6-30 volunteers.

While all Hardrock Aid Stations strive to maintain a high level of care for the runners, logistics such as space, access and location necessarily cause some differences in what is available. Each aid station, regardless of location, typically goes above & beyond with a specialty "off-menu" dish for runners.

**Hike-In (Kroger's Canteen, Engineer, Pole Creek):**
The intrepid volunteers who staff these aid stations carry in all supplies using their own strong backs (and pack animals, if available), sometimes making multiple trips. Tasks include on-site filtering of gallons of water, digging a latrine, and collecting & chopping firewood. Food variety is limited, but the essentials are available of typical aid station food groups. Their backcountry location makes it important to abide by Leave No Trace principles and keep staffing numbers smaller. No Crew Access.

**Road-Side (KT, Chapman, Governors, Burrows, Maggie, Cunningham):**
These aid stations are car-accessible, at least via 4WD, but parking can be extremely limited. Check with your Aid Station Captain if they recommend carpooling. Water may be trucked in, or filtered on site. A wider food variety is typical, with multiple hot food options. Generators, port-a-potties, crew access and drop bags may or may not be available.

**"The Big 4" (Telluride, Ouray, Grouse, Sherman):**
With the widest variety of available amenities, the "Big 4" aid stations can be depended on to have copious options for hot food & beverages, drop bags & other services. Electricity, port-a-potties/bathrooms, crew access and drop bags are standard. They have lots of action, lots of people, and generally the biggest volunteer staffs.

A typical aid station menu contains:
|                |                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Coffee/Tea/Cocoa | Pretzels               |
| Coke/Ginger Ale  | Soup/Miso              |

| Cookies          | Fig Bars               |
| Chips            | Bananas/Oranges/Melons |
 
Stations with vehicle access will also likely have:
|                 |                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
|                   |                            |
| Boiled Potatoes   | Boiled Sweet Potatoes      |
| Turkey Sandwiches | Wraps/Quesadillas/Burritos |
| Avocadoes         | Bacon & Eggs               |
| Pumpkin Pie       | Black Beans & Rice         |
| Brisket           |                            |
 
Hardrock will strive to have options for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free runners. However, the accessibility of some aid stations may limit selection. 
 
Runners with severe food restrictions should be prepared with their own food, as cross-contamination is hard to prevent in the backcountry.
