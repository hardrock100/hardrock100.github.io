### Keeping Hardrock Green
 
A core value of Hardrock is responsibility to the lands on which we run and the communities in which we operate. It is our responsibility to reduce negative impacts every chance we get. Hardrock:
*Is a cupless event. Every aid station will have reusable cups, dishware, and a wash kit; runners do not need to carry their own cup. No disposable dishware will be provided by Run HQ.
*Is working to reduce traffic at key wilderness areas: Chapman (Ophir), Grouse, Sherman, and Cunningham in particular
*Is constantly expanding our recycling & composting during run week – look for information at the gym
 
It takes awareness and effort by everyone - runners, crews, volunteers, spectators, media, etc. - to reduce our collective impact. 
 
Here are some ideas to help us all do even better! Keep these in mind during the run, when you are training, or just out exploring the San Juan Mountains!
 
**Runners**
* Don’t litter! Pick up trash you find on trail
* Use reusable dispensers on trail and buy products in bulk
* Embrace cupless running
* Plan with your crew to reduce traffic to aid stations
* Learn and Practice “Leave No Trace”
* Practice low-impact use of the wilderness any time you are on the trail
 
**Crews**
* Bring supplies such as reusable cups, plates, and utensils
* Collect recyclables and make sure they get recycled
* Reduce the number of vehicles going to aid stations – carpool!
* Learn the rules for responsible off-road driving, stay on designated routes and observe right-of-way on narrow mountain dirt roads
* Park in designated spots only
* Don’t litter! Pick up trash you find on trail
* Pick up after your pets
 
**Volunteers**
