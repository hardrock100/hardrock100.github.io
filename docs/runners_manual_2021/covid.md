## 2021 COVID-19 Safety Protocols

Our goal is a COVID safe yet fulfilling run experience. Our safety protocols are focused on achieving this goal by requiring masks, minimizing mass gatherings, and reducing contact points. **We recommend in the strongest possible terms that all participants (runners, crews/pacers, volunteers, spectators, etc.) come fully vaccinated.**

We all look forward to a fun, relaxed atmosphere celebrating a return after 2 years of Hardrock cancellations, yet we also appreciate that things will look a little different.  

Our approval to hold this run is contingent on following these protocols recommended by our permitting authorities and specifically the San Juan, Hinsdale, Ouray and San Miguel County public health officials.  We appreciate you playing your part. 

Those not cooperating will be asked to leave and could be subject to disqualification or barred from entering future Hardrocks.  Runners are responsible for the actions of their crew/pacers.   The intent of these protocols matters more than exact wording – so please don’t look for loopholes – and do your best to embrace the changes and our need to manage everyone’s safety. 

For purposes of the run, we consider your “household” to be the runner together with their crew/pacers.  We ask social distancing by household under that definition, and leave it to individual runners if they want further restrictions within their household.

These protocols are in line with current national, state and local regulations.  They are subject to change if regulations are updated.

### Major Elements:
* Masks must be worn at all times. Exceptions are limited (below)
* Run Briefing and Awards Breakfast moved outdoors
* Strong suggestion that each runner limit their crew/pacers to no more than 3 
* Discouragement of spectators / those not directly involved in the run

**Masks:**
All participants are expected to WEAR A MASK at all times.  Exceptions are limited to:
* Eating/Drinking: Please individually socially distance by 6’+.
* Runners: may remove masks when on course outside of aid stations.
* Everyone Else: may remove masks when outside and more than 6’ distanced by household.

**Start/Finish:**
* A perimeter will be established in the immediate vicinity of the start, limited only to runners and run staff
* Crews attending the start will be required to spread out, socially distanced by households.  The runners have 7 blocks through town - use them all!
* While each runner deserves to be celebrated, the area by the gym is one of the hot spots for potential large crowds.  We ask that folks avoid generally hanging out by the finish. Cheer in those runners you have a personal connection to, and use the live tracking via OpenSplitTime to focus your time at the finish.
* Runners will be allowed the traditional kissing of the Hardrock at the finish.  The rock will be sanitized between each smooch.  We discourage French kissing (unless you are French, of course).

**Crews/Pacers:**
* Runners are strongly suggested to limit their total crew/pacers to 3 (including kids).  Crew/pacers must pre-register for contact tracing.
* Crews/pacers must maintain social distancing by household when outside their vehicle.
* While at aid stations, crews/pacers are asked to wait inside their vehicles or well away from the immediate aid area as much as reasonable.  We know cell service is extremely limited, and parking is typically single-file on a roadside, so it's not easy to see when your runner arrives.  Be patient, use good judgment and be respectful.
* Aid stations where crew access is allowed will have relaxed boundaries for crewing to allow for social distancing.  A good rule of thumb is “within sight” of the station (roughly a quarter mile), as long as it does not interfere with vehicle traffic.

**Spectators:**
Spectators are strongly discouraged from attending Hardrock this year.  The run can have a high potential for large crowds, especially in Silverton-based events and at the Ouray and Telluride Aid Stations.  Help us keep our runners safe (and permits intact) by limiting attendance to those with an official role with this year’s run, and enjoy our multiple [live online tracking](https://www.hardrock100.com/) options.

**Run Headquarters:**
* Porta-Potties and Hand Wash station numbers will be increased.  All portos will be stocked with hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray or wipes & be regularly sanitized.
* Runner and Volunteer Briefings will be held outdoors at Memorial Park.  In case of inclement weather, bring an umbrella (this is Hardrock).
* During the run, the gym will be limited to communications, medical and post-run recovery.  Entry will only be at the NW door and exit only at the SE door.
  * A set number of tables will be available for runners to sit, eat and recover.  Only one household per table.  If capacity is reached, we will ask runners who have spent time inside to exit to allow newly finished runners to enter.
* The Awards Breakfast will occur outdoors at Memorial Park.  We will do our best to have an abundance of tents, but in case of inclement weather, bring umbrellas (again, this is Hardrock).  Meals will be individually plated.
* Public Showers in the Silverton Gym will NOT be available.  Locker room capacity is strongly suggested to be a maximum of 3 individuals at any time.

**Aid Stations:**
Personal, one-on-one service that Hardrock prides itself on is a low priority for 2021.  Contact minimization is the greater goal.  Runners should plan to be self-sufficient as much as reasonable.
* Masks are required in aid stations.  Boundaries (where reasonable) will be set between the service area (wear masks) and eating/drinking area (mask removal is fine with 6’ distancing).
* No communal food bowls.  Runners will not have direct access to the food.  A masked/gloved volunteer will distribute individual servings in individual plates/bowls/cups and sanitize the serving table between each runner.
* Fluid service is no-touch.  Runners must open their own bottles/bladders, and a masked/gloved volunteer pours.  If contact is made, serving pitchers will be sanitized.
* Aid stations where crews are allowed will:
  * Have tight boundaries around the immediate aid station where only runners and volunteers are allowed.
  * Have relaxed crewing boundaries in the general area to allow households to socially distance (6’+ between households, especially if masks are removed).
* Warming tents will have a maximum occupancy of 6, and no crews allowed inside. 
* Chairs and/or cots will be situated a reasonable distance away from the aid station (and at least 6 feet apart from each other) to reduce crowd densities at aid stations. 
* We have ample supplies of space blankets (which will not be reused) should runners need to be kept warm. All chairs and cots will be sanitized between use. 
* A hand-sanitizer station will be set up at the entrance to each aid station.
* The food selection may be simplified.  Priority will be given to foods runners are unable to provide in their drop bags (hot foods, fresh fruit, etc).  A full menu list will be published pre-run.
* If shuttles are used for any aid station access, capacity will be limited.
Safety and Medical Personnel will be staffed to full levels at the start/finish and aid stations.  All medical personnel will follow current established guidelines for patient care including but not limited to masks, gloves, eye protection, sanitizing wipes and proper disposal. 

**Escalation:**
We acknowledge that COVID cases could spike to the point where additional restrictions are required, but the run is still safe to hold in a more limited format. Those additional limitations could include:
* Packet Pickup
  * Runners will enter/exit the gym in a single-direction line, and be limited on how many may enter the gym at a time.  Check in stations will be 8 feet apart. Those waiting in line will have marked spaces to maintain social distancing.
* Awards Breakfast
  * No food service
  * Attendance restrictions (such as only to runners & run staff)
  * Full cancellation
* Runner Briefing
  * If serious inclement weather, the briefing will be moved to the gym and restricted to runners and staff
  * Attendance restrictions (such as only to runners & run staff)
  * Move to virtual
* Additional restrictions on Crews and Pacer Exchanges
  * Access limited only to stations with considerable space to spread out (Sherman, Ouray, Telluride)
  * Reduction of crew/pacer numbers and/or stricter enforcement
  * Reduction in other run personnel (staff, volunteers, media)
  * If aid station volunteers are restricted, menus and services will be simplified
* Wave starts to further spread out runners, pacers and crews on course
 
In the event that someone associated with the run tests positive for COVID-19 in the two weeks post-event, we will follow strict CDC guidelines on reporting and communication to all potentially exposed parties.  The individual’s identification will be protected.
